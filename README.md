### Description
Youâ€™re controlling a Mech, armed to the teeth with armour and weapons, and fighting non-stop waves of deadly robots in a post apocalyptic wasteland. The player must master the complex controls of the Mech in order to survive, wreak as much havoc as possible and then extract.

The game is a First Person Shooter with vehicle simulator elements. This allows us to take full advantage of the Oculus Rift and physical controls such as joysticks and pedals to provide players the visceral experience of piloting a real Mech.
